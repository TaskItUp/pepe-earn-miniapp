# Simple Referral System - Final Implementation

## How It Works

### User A (Referrer):
1. Gets unique referral code: `https://t.me/pepe_rewardbot?start=UNIQUE_CODE`
2. Shares link with friends

### User B (New User):
1. Clicks User A's referral link
2. Starts the bot with referral parameter
3. Instantly: User A's referral count goes up by +1
4. When User B watches ads: User A earns 10% commission (25 PEPE)

## Technical Flow:

```
User B clicks: https://t.me/pepe_rewardbot?start=ABC123
↓
Bot starts with start_param = "ABC123"  
↓
System finds User A who has referralCode = "ABC123"
↓
Sets User B's referredBy = User A's ID
↓
User A's totalReferrals += 1 (instant)
↓
When User B watches ad (250 PEPE):
  - User B gets 250 PEPE
  - User A gets 25 PEPE (10% commission)
```
